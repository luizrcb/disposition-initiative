# FoundryVTT Disposition Initiative

## Overview

Disposition Initiative is a Foundry VTT module that simplifies initiative rolls by letting one token roll for an entire side. Instead of every token rolling separately, the module randomly selects a representative from each disposition group — friendly, neutral, secret, or hostile — and uses that single roll for the whole group.

This keeps combat moving quickly, especially in larger encounters, while still keeping things fair and dynamic.

### Features

- Automatically groups tokens by their disposition (friendly, neutral, secret and hostile).
- Randomly selects a token from each group to roll initiative.
- Applies the result to all tokens in that group.
- Lightweight and easy to use — no extra setup required.
